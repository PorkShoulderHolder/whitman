  "body": "whitman\r\n=======\r\n\r\nA Collection of the tools I made to scrape, analyse, and catalogue all of Walt Whitman's correspondence from 1860 to 1876.\r\nAnd more importantly, the information I gathered in the form of text, JSON, pickle, and BSON.\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this is to make the Whitman Correspondence data available in widely used formats and to promote the review and visualization of this unique dataset.\r\n\r\nAside from NE_Tagger and jsonmaker, much of the scripts will have little use outside of providing examples of screen scraping and text analysis using nltk. I included them\r\nas a reference to where the data files came from.\r\n\r\nMy friend presented this to me as a potential project months ago when he noticed how extensive the whitmanArchives website was.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of the more useful objects:\r\n\r\n##NE_Tagger\r\n\r\nThe NE_Record object takes a section of text as well as an optional text heading parameter and then performs the\r\nrelevant named entity recognition and populates its people, locations,\r\n\r\n    >>>from NE_Tagger import NE_Record\r\n\r\n    >>>netagger = NE_Tagger(\"Dear mother, the heat is awful, please let me come home to Camden, Mass\", \"Letter from Walt Whitman to his Mother\")\r\n\r\n    >>>print netagger.sender\r\n\r\n    \"Walt Whitman\"\r\n\r\n    >>>print netagger.locations\r\n\r\n    [\"Camden\"]\r\n\r\netc...\r\n\r\n##jsonmaker\r\n\r\nThe jsonmaker object provides a light wrapper for the json module to convert python objects to json/bson files\r\n\r\n    >>>from jsonmaker import *\r\n\r\n    >>>saveToFileAsJSON(obj,'myfile.json',readable = True)\r\n\r\n    >>>saveToFileAsBSON(obj,'myfile.bson)\r\n\r\n\r\nData\r\n====\r\n\r\n1. whitmanData.txt is the raw csv file generated by whitmanCrawler.py, and cleanedWhitmanData.txt is a nicer version of this with 'normalized dates' associated with each letter.\r\n\r\n2. whitmanjson.json and it's bson counterpart are the big fishes here. They are arrays of jsonized NE_Record objects, (one entry per letter), consisting of all sorts of easy to use\r\ndescriptors about the letter such as the sender, and recipient (as interpreted by my scripts), locations, geo-political entities, and more, even including the latlngs of everything that was recognized as a place.\r\nBelow is an example entry that represents one letter (the full json is an array of the letters). A key for the parts of speech tags\r\ncan be found in Table 5.1 of http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch05.html\r\n\r\n##example from whitmanjson.json\r\n\r\n    {\r\n       \"taggedHeading\":[         /* this is the heading of the letter after being processed by nltk's\r\n                                    pos (parts of speech) tagger.
